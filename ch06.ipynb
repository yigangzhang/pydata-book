Joining these back to the original `DataFrame` is a little awkward. It\\'d be nice to have a top-level `explode()` similar to how `DataFrame.explode()` works on lists.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nAdd a new StructFrameAccessor to `pandas/core/arrays/arrow/accessors.py`. I think implementation could be almost identical to what I did here: https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-dataframes/pull/916\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nclass StructFrameAccessor:\\r\\n    \"\"\"\\r\\n    Accessor object for structured data properties of the DataFrame values.\\r\\n    \"\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    def __init__(self, data: DataFrame) -> None:\\r\\n        self._parent = data\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    def explode(self, column, *, separator: str = \".\"):\\r\\n        \"\"\"\\r\\n        Extract all child fields of struct column(s) and add to the DataFrame.\\r\\n\\r\\n        **Examples:**\\r\\n\\r\\n            >>> countries = pd.Series([\"cn\", \"es\", \"us\"])\\r\\n            >>> files = pd.Series(\\r\\n            ...

Potentially with an `axis` parameter to explode into columns instead of rows.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nSee also, the `Series.struct` accessor added last year: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/54977',\n",

This shouldn\\'t make a difference as the dataframe only contains the predictions column outside of the columns used to group and roll on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis difference causes two issues in the dataframe where I don\\'t select a subset of the columns:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The old index is appended as an additional unnamed level\\r\\n2. The datetime column is kept as a column instead of as an index level\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI would expect both cases to behave the way the second example does, with `id, area, datetime` as the index levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.15.0-1066-azure\\r\\nVersion               : #75-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 30 14:29:45 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 2.1.0\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : None\\r\\npip                   : None\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.26.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

There isn\\'t limited space here so I think linewrapping is unnecessary for such short data. I have searched in [Pandas \"Options and Settings\" page](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/options.html#available-options)) and there is currently no option to configure this behaviour. I would be really grateful if this gets implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a new option to configure linewrapping behaviour for columns, e.g. `display.linewrap` that accepts boolean values, `True` to enable linewrapping and `False` otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nNone\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\n_No response_',\n",

I opened a new issue as it\\'s not exactly the same example, but feel free to close if it\\'s not relevant. Not even sure it\\'s a bug or not, sorry if i\\'m mistaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reading a dataframe from CSV, if the columns have empty values, it gets filled with `\"Unnamed: ...\"` pattern. This makes sense for regular 1D columns, as they need to be unique. When it comes to columns using multiindex, the uniqueness can be ensured even with empty values, if the other levels are different. Current implementation uses `\"Unnamed: ...\"` in both cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reading index with Multiindex, empty values don\\'t get replaced. The index read from CSV in the minimal example is identical to the initial index.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\n- I would expect consistency in the handling of MultiIndex by index & columns. Maybe it\\'s not feasible due to the uniqueness required by columns & not by index\\r\\n\\r\\n- Empty values should be left unfilled if the index remains unique. This would require an identification of duplicates in the multiindex before filling the values, thus losing consistency within the handling of MultiIndex for columns\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.12.2.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 11\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 140 Stepping 1, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : fr_FR.cp1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : None\\r\\npip                   : 24.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

For example, when obtaining results from an analytical database from a query like\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\nSELECT count(distinct device_id) as device_count, avg(score) as score GROUP BY ...\\r\\n```\\r\\nWe expect `device_count` to always be accurate, but `score` is expected to have random numerical floating point inaccuracies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy old code ran `assert_frame_equal` several times on different subsets of columns, which is cumbersome and doesn\\'t express the intent well.\\r\\nI recently refactored it by extracting `assert_frame_equal`\\'s implementation and just adding the extra arguments to support per-column customizable `rtol` and `atol`.\\r\\nIt would be nice if such an ability was built into Pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this overlaps a bit with feature request https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54861 .\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nOne way is to add extra arguments to `assert_frame_equal`, usable like so:\\r\\n\\r\\n```py\\r\\nassert_frame_equal(\\r\\n    left,\\r\\n    right,\\r\\n    rtol=1e-5,\\r\\n    atol=1e-8,\\r\\n    rtols={\\'device_count\\': 0, \\'score\\': 1e-6},\\r\\n    atols={\\'device_count\\': 0}, # for unspecified columns, the rtol/atol argument is used as default\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\nOr the entire comparison configuration (`check_exact`, `check_datetimelike_compat` etc) could be overridden per-series, for example\\r\\n```py\\r\\nassert_frame_equal(\\r\\n    left,\\r\\n    right,\\r\\n    overrides={\\r\\n        \\'device_count\\': {\\'check_exact\\': True},\\r\\n        \\'score\\': {\\'rtol\\': 1e-6},\\r\\n    }\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current way to do it with public APIs is to do something like\\r\\n```py\\r\\nfor column_names, rtol in [([\"device_count\", ...], 0.0), ([\"score\", ...], 1e-6), ...]:\\r\\n    left = # extract index and columns from left\\r\\n    right = # extract index and columns from right\\r\\n    assert_frame_equal(left, right, rtol=rtol)\\r\\n```',\n",
